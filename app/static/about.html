        <h2>About <i>Sounding Tennyson</i></h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> presents sonic and textual versions of one of Tennyson’s most famous poems,
            “Break, break, break.” This poem has attracted considerable attention for how to scan the first line: do we pause at the commas (and for how long) or read through them?
            Tennyson found in music a way to convey his sonorous intentions for those beyond his immediate circle.
        </p>

        <p>
            [Blue sections are for entry points to those sections.]
            The <a href="#/music">Music</a> section on our site shows images of musical scores
            (mostly by Tennyson’s wife, Emily) and gives the option to play the songs,
            with each measure marked in time with the music.
            Users can compare any one musical setting to other musical and textual drafts.
            The scores can be silently examined through the <a href="#/music">Music</a> or <a href="#/archive">Archives</a> tab,
            which includes all the digitized items featured on <i>Sounding Tennyson</i>.
            An "Earwitness" section contains observers' accounts of listening to Tennyson or his
            family recite and the poet's response to hearing his poetry set to music.
            Following the <a href="#/essays">Essays</a> link brings up short articles, both highly
            specific to the poem and contextual. Clicking on the <a href="index.html">Tennyson icon</a> returns

        <h3>Presented objects and experiences</h3>
        [Regarding the Green sections – I hope you’ll use some color for these items. They’re not links – I just want to make them more easily noticed]

        <div class="standout">Music</div>
        The following resources are presented as images and recorded sound, which can be experienced either individually or together.

        <div class="standout">Historic context</div>
        We aim to situate the performed music in its cultural context. We cannot exactly replicate Victorian conditions,
        but we wish to give the user the closest possible perspective to the original listener in terms of historic instrumentation,
        performance practice, acoustics and ambient sound, and even the look of the drawing room where the Tennysons played music and recited poetry.
        <ul class="diamond">
            <li><span class="standout_text">Queen Victoria’s piano:</span> 1858 Broadwood square. Because the Tennysons’ own piano is not available, we recorded with a period instrument that Tennyson likely encountered.
                He was friendly with Queen Victoria and they were neighbors on the Isle of Wight and in London.
                [pop out section on the piano [like the glossary]: Prince Albert chose this piano for Buckingham Palace,
                where it was used for concerts and balls during Albert’s lifetime. The Prince Consort was highly musical and probably played this instrument.
                After he died in 1861, Queen Victoria arranged with John Broadwood & Sons for the instrument to be permanently loaned for Prince Albert’s memorial room.]

        <h3>Full Description</h3>
        <p>
            Scholarship frequently refers to Alfred Tennyson as a musical poet (or even the most musical of poets),
            without stopping to consider the precise meaning or consequences of the designation (Griffith 1989; Hollander 1975).
            On the one hand, “musicality” serves as a more or less figurative description for the evident sonorous qualities of Tennyson’s verse.
            On the other, much informative research has elaborated the complex historical mediation of Tennyson’s poetry into settings that range from parlor ballads to the music hall,
            from Gilbert and Sullivan’s Princess Ida (1884) to Arthur Sullivan’s Cycle of Songs from Maud (1898), without necessarily leading to a reconsideration of Tennyson’s poetry itself
            (Hughes 1986).
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> intends, however, to consider poetry and music concurrently, and to do more as well:
            for the dialogue between poetry and music also exposes a more continuous and bilateral collaboration between Alfred and Emily Tennyson
            than has previously been supposed. Such an approach radically reassesses the past quarter century of scholarship on Victorian poetry which locates voice on the page,
            in meter (Griffith 1989; Rowlinson 2002; Prins 1999, 2004, 2005, 2008a, 2008b; Helsinger 2010; Hall 2011; Martin and Levin 2011).
            The academy has supported this approach with prizes (Martin 2012) and funding (Princeton Prosody Archive).
        </p>

        <p>
            Our project builds tools to facilitate work on the sonic dimensions of Tennyson’s poetry.
            Of course, Tennyson circulated his polished poetry in print, and handwritten and printed drafts were crucial to the poet’s compositional process
            (Bushell 2009). However, Tennyson’s drafting process was often oral: he recited new poems before writing, sometimes asking his friend, Arthur Hallam,
            and later his wife, Emily, to write while he spoke. During drafting and after publication, Tennyson recited his poems to family and friends.
            Voicing his verse was essential to conveying the meaning of the poems, perhaps especially because the recitation and printed page sometimes communicated different
            meanings or effects (e.g., in Tennyson’s extant phonograph recordings of 1890, we hear the poet laureate ignoring written punctuation) (Weliver 2017).
            While Tennyson’s phonographic recitations remained within the family parlor (the wax cylinder recordings were not commercially duplicated in his lifetime),
            through sanctioned musical settings, Tennyson’s “voice” did reach a wider audience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
        </p>

        <p>
            The present object of recovering the sound of Tennyson’s poetry aims to unearth forgotten depths of Tennyson’s intentions and techniques as well as better to understand what
            Victorian poetry itself was conceived to be: it was sonic and musical as well as written. This project foregrounds how Victorians associated verse with music,
            as seen in the popularity of melodrama (speech accompanied by music) (Hibberd 2011; Pisani 2004).
            Tennyson’s poetry was part of a larger cultural moment when the public heard poetry and music together.
        </p>

        <p>
            The website materials include the first recordings and publications of Emily Tennyson’s piano/vocal settings of the poem,
            which preserve aspects of her husband’s recitation. The recordings were made in the drawing room at Farringford, using a historic piano,
            thereby approximating sonic social experience by including sounds that friends and family would have heard (e.g., wind gusting outside).
            The trained performers are also scholars and therefore aware of historically informed performances.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> thus offers a new means of approaching both the canonical author and the archive. In the case of the former,
            we reveal Tennyson’s compositional practice to be more plural and complex than commonly supposed; in the case of the latter,
            we view archival materials not merely as deposits in a repository. Rather, we help a user to interact with real time performance and contrast it to other archival materials.
        </p>

        <p>
            We place performance at the center of the archive for the first time (rather than perceiving the archive as a mere “repository”),
            while suggesting that its plurality is not simply “ambiguity,” but instead reveals myriad historical and interpretative facts. Another existing tool,
            Augmented Notes and its sister site Songs of the Victorians, shows and plays music with each measure marked in time with the music.
            This last is closer to what we have developed (indeed, we use Augmented Notes technology as a step in our website creation), but we also feature a tool that
            allows us to toggle between one representation of a poem and another, thus juxtaposing multiple versions. Overall, <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> aims to highlight the
            compositional context of how a poem was written and what it sounded like when performed, allowing for a wide range of sonic presentations, including stress,
            duration, pitch, dynamics, tempo and atmospheric qualities, as well as variant punctuation and word choice.
        </p>

        <div class="standout">Methodology and standards</div>
        <p>
            Three overlapping methodologies are at work for this project. The first undergirds the cataloging component from an IT perspective.
            We have used the Metadata Object Descriptions Schema (MODS), the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Music Encoding Initiative (MEI),
            which has been customized according to the content we encounter. To this we have added a IIIF dimension.
            All two-dimensional objects have been assigned a IIIF Manifest. A Canvas is an abstract representation of a single digital object and acts as
            the central node between the digital object and annotated data that point to the object. A Manifest is a sequence of Canvases that is equivalent to compound objects
            in the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) schema. In this framework, metadata descriptions and scholarly annotations are all treated as linked open data,
            annotations that point to the Canvas of a specific object. Moreover, IIIF supports both annotations that range across many Canvases, as well as more granular
            targeting where an annotation points to a specific region on a given Canvas. A Manifest normally points to a compound object residing in a single repository,
            but an inherent function of a IIIF Manifest is to point to digital objects that are distributed across two or more repositories.
            This process will prove highly advantageous as the cataloging of Tennysoniana develops.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second methodology is the cataloging process developed to catalogue and digitally present multiple versions of “Break, break, break,”
            which include several drafts of a piano/vocal score composed by Emily Tennyson. This dedicated study of “Break, break, break”
            gives the project an early opportunity to establish the metadata for a few complex objects (ranging from the manuscript to the published,
            the textual to the musical score and its performance). Using standard metadata categories, we are creating transcriptions of images in TEI and MEI, in tandem with EAD.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, we take a multimodal and interdisciplinary approach to interpreting “Break, break, break,” in relation to its various textual and musical instantiations.
            In consultation with team members, the PI has addressed questions about how the archival object can best be digitally presented (e.g., how clearly to present multiple
            objects through essays that show their links, through toggling among digitized objects, and through an archival listing). We have also determined what editing and annotation
            protocols are required for individual items, and items in relation to one another.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University (CDH) has now built a web-based platform to support and provide access to all the components of this project.
            All the data is housed in a IIIF annotation store, including the Manifests, the metadata and scholarly annotations created by the team. That data will be generated through
            a user interface (UI) that will allow the team to identify digital objects stored either at Saint Louis University or remotely at Cambridge Digital Library (or elsewhere),
            build the Manifests for the compound objects, generate and store metadata (as well as modify existing records), and add scholarly annotations where appropriate.
            Users will furthermore have access to the digitized objects using any IIIF tool such as Mirador. Mirador is a JavaScript plugin that is IIIF compliant and provides a
            number of ways to display digital images. In addition, the CDH has implemented an API that will allow third parties full and open access to the Manifests, metadata and scholarly
            annotation.
        </p>

        <div class="standout">Sustainability of project outcomes and digital content</div>
        <p>
            The Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University (CDH) is committed to long-term preservation and curation of all related metadata and annotation data.
            These will be stored in the CDH’s IIIF-annotation store, which is part of the Saint Louis University network. Storage is supported by regular tape back up to avoid any data loss.
            Data stored on this annotation store will always be accessible through a set of APIs. All data stored as IIIF objects adhere strictly to the W3C
            standard supported by a growing community of 30 international institutions, including Bodleian Libraries, British Library, Harvard University and Stanford University.
            This community is committed to supporting the format as an open standard and has already created several tools and shims that assure IIIF remains modern, interoperable,
            portable and convertible in the future when technologies surpass its capacity for data.

        <div class="standout">Future development</div>
        <p>With time, the <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> site will expand to include the twenty-four poems with words by Alfred Tennyson and music by Emily Tennyson, each in multiple drafts.</p>
        <p>
            The tools built for <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> by the Center for Digital Research at Saint Louis University are currently an exhibition site. With future funding,
            we will develop these tools so that they become iterative in nature. Thus the manner in which “Break, break, break” is presented can be repeated for the other musical
            settings by Tennyson’s poems. These tools can additionally be shared with and adapted by other users and projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Sounding Tennyson</i> is part of an international digital humanities project, Tennysons Archive [hyperlink for WordPress page].
            Phyllis Weliver and Ewan Jones are co-Principal Investigators for Tennysons Archive, a IIIF-compatible project which is larger than a single project, digital portal or grant.
