	<h2>About <em>Sounding Tennyson</em></h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The digital humanities project, <em>Sounding Tennyson</em>, explores Tennyson’s poetry as a process of 
 
 multiple people and art forms. For Britain’s poet laureate, composition and performance were 
 
 tightly interwoven, not opposites.</p> 

<p>At present, <em>Sounding Tennyson</em> presents sonic and textual versions of one of Tennyson’s most 

famous poems, “Break, break, break”: three musical draft settings (music by Emily Tennyson), 

published song (Emily’s music arranged), another musical version of the poem performed for the 

poet, a draft of the poem, the published poem, and written records of hearing “Break, break, 

break” recited and performed (published and unpublished). With time, the site will expand to 

include over twenty more poems with words by Alfred Tennyson and music by Emily Tennyson, 

similarly revised multiple times. We additionally aim to present on this site the extant 

phonograph recitations made by Tennyson in 1890.</p>

<p>The tools built for <em>Sounding Tennyson</em> by the Center for Digital Research at Saint Louis 

University are currently an exhibition site. With future funding, we will develop these tools so as 

to become iterative in nature. Thus the manner in which “Break, break, break” is presented can 

be repeated for the other multi-draft musical settings by Emily Tennyson of her husband’s 

poems. These tools can additionally be shared with and adapted by other users and projects.</p>

<h4>Significance and Impact of Research
</h4>
<dl class="dl-inline">
<dt>Unique content:</dt>
 <dd>While there are digital archival groupings of other major writers, strangely 
 
 Tennyson’s archives have not yet received attention. </dd>

<dt>Recovery:</dt>
 <dd>The vocal/piano pieces composed by Emily to Alfred’s words are unrecorded and 
 
 unpublished up to now; scholars have mostly been unaware of their existence. Simply making 
 
 them available would be worthwhile, but our manner of presentation goes beyond republication 
 
 alone; it makes these materials <em>accessible</em> to non-musicians. This accessible recovery will 
 
 considerably shift scholarly views of Tennyson’s oeuvre.</dd>

<dt>Innovative methodology:</dt>
<dd> No other digital project seeks to use sound as an experiential way of 

conceptually thinking through an archive, nor are there theoretical writings on this topic within 

digital humanities.</dd>

<h4>Full Description
</h4>
<p>Scholarship frequently refers to Tennyson as a musical poet (or even the most musical of poets), 

without stopping to consider the precise meaning or consequences of the designation (Griffith 1989; Hollander 1975). On the one hand, “musicality” serves as a more or less figurative 

description for the evident sonorous qualities of Tennyson’s verse. On the other, much 

informative research has elaborated the complex historical mediation of Tennyson’s poetry into 

settings that range from parlor ballads to the music hall, from Gilbert and Sullivan’s <EM>Princess Ida</EM> 

(1884) to Arthur Sullivan’s <em>Cycle of Songs from Maud</em> (1898), without necessarily leading to a 

reconsideration of Tennyson’s poetry itself (Hughes 1986).</p>

<p>Our project intends, however, to consider poetry and music concurrently, and to do more as well: 

for the dialogue between poetry and music also exposes a more continuous and bilateral 

collaboration between Alfred and Emily Tennyson than has previously been supposed. Such an 

approach radically reassesses the past quarter century of scholarship on Victorian poetry which 

locates voice on the page, in meter (Griffith 1989; Rowlinson 2002; Prins 1999, 2004, 2005, 

2008a, 2008b; Helsinger 2010; Hall 2011; Martin and Levin 2011). The academy has supported 

this approach with prizes (<a target="_blank" href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9715.html">Martin 2012</a>) and funding <a target="_blank" href="https://english.princeton.edu/news/prosody-archive-awarded-mellon-foundation-officers-grant">(<em>Princeton Prosody Archive</em>)</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sounding Tennyson</em> builds tools to facilitate work on the sonic dimensions of Tennyson’s poetry. 

Tennyson certainly circulated his polished poetry in print, and handwritten and printed drafts 

were crucial to the poet’s inspirational process (Bushell 2009). However, Tennyson’s drafting 

process was often oral: he recited new poems before writing, sometimes asking his friend, Arthur 

Hallam, and later his wife, Emily, to write while he spoke. Rather than poetry being only a silent, 

page-bound process, Tennyson literally voiced the verse during pre-writing, drafting and post-

publication. Among those who were part of Tennyson’s circle, print was an alternative effect or 

variant in contrast to the live voice of the poet whose performance was inseparable from the 

poetry’s meaning. Tennyson’s anxiety to preserve this meaning persisted for a lifetime. The 

encounter with the poet’s voice was relatively limited, being the province of kinship, friendship, 

power, prestige and/or artistic networks (Weliver 2017). However, through sanctioned musical 

settings, Tennyson’s “voice” did reach a wider audience in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<p>The present object of recovering Tennyson’s sounds aims to unearth forgotten depths of 

Tennyson’s intentions and techniques as well as to better understand what Victorian poetry itself 

was conceived to be: it was sonic and musical as well as written (studies of Browning, Hopkins, 

Lear, D.G. Rossetti and Swinburne could also benefit from our approach). This project 

foregrounds how Victorians associated verse with music, as seen in the popularity of melodrama 

(speech accompanied by music) (Hibberd 2011; Pisani 2004). Tennyson’s poetry was part of a 

larger cultural moment when the public heard poetry and music together.</p>

<p>The website materials include the first recordings and publications of Emily Tennyson’s 

piano/vocal settings of the poem, which preserve aspects of her husband’s recitation. The 

recordings were made in the drawing room at the Tennysons’ restored home, Farringford, using a 

historic piano, thus approximating sonic social experience by including sounds that friends and 

family would have heard (e.g., wind gusting outside). The trained performers are also scholars 

and therefore aware of historically informed performances. The digital application shows images 

of the score and plays the songs, with each measure marked in time with the music. Users can 

also compare multiple musical and textual drafts, read commentary and make annotations 

themselves. The process makes accessible the musical settings to scholars and students who may 

otherwise find music to be a foreign language, thus widening the community who can respond to 

the Tennysons’ musical material.</p>

<p>The project offers a new means of approaching both the canonical author and the archive. In the 

case of the former, we reveal Tennyson’s compositional practice to be more plural and complex 

than commonly supposed; in the case of the latter, we view archival materials not merely as 

deposits in a repository. Rather, we help a user to interact with real time performance and 

contrast it to other archival materials. The process also makes accessible the musical settings to 

literary scholars who may otherwise find music to be a foreign and exclusive language, thus 

widening the community who can respond to the material.</p>

<p>We thus differ from the <a target="_blank" href="https://english.princeton.edu/news/prosody-archive-awarded-mellon-foundation-officers-grant"><em>Princeton Prosody Archive</em></a>, a searchable library focusing on writings on 

prosody (marking meter), which does not take performance into account and looks at treatises 

instead of poems. <a target="_blank" href="http://prosody.lib.virginia.edu/">For Better For Verse</a>, an interactive tool for teaching meter, does deal with 

performance, but in a normative (right/wrong) manner. We place performance at the center of the 

archive for the first time (rather than perceiving the archive as a mere “repository”), while 

suggesting that its plurality is not simply “ambiguity,” but instead reveals myriad historical and 

interpretative facts. Another existing tool, <A TARGET="_blank" href="http://www.augmentednotes.com/">Augmented Notes</A> and its sister site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.songsofthevictorians.com/">Songs of the 

Victorians</a>, shows and plays music with each measure marked in time with the music. This last is 

closer to what we have developed (indeed, we used Augmented Notes technology as a step in our 

website creation), but we also feature a tool that allows us to toggle between one representation 

of a poem and another, thus juxtaposing multiple versions. Overall, <em>Sounding Tennyson</em> aims to 

highlight the compositional context of how a poem was written and what it sounded like when 

performed, allowing for a wide range of sonic presentations, including stress, duration, pitch, 

dynamics, tempo and atmospheric qualities, as well as variant punctuation and word choice.</p>

<h4>Methodology and standards.</h4> 
<p>Three overlapping methodologies are at work for this project. The 

first undergirds the cataloging component from an IT perspective. We have used the Metadata 

Object Descriptions Schema (MODS), the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Music Encoding 

Initiative (MEI), which has been customized according to the content we encounter. To this we 

have added a IIIF dimension. All two-dimensional objects have been assigned a IIIF canvas. A 

canvas is an abstract representation of a single digital object and acts as the central node between 

the digital object and annotated data that point to the object. A manifest is a series of canvases 

that is equivalent to compound objects in the EAD schema. In this framework, metadata 

descriptions and scholarly annotations are all treated as linked open data, annotations that point 

to the canvas of a specific object. Moreover, IIIF supports both annotations that range across 

many canvases, as well as more granular targeting where an annotation points to a specific 

region on a given canvas. A manifest normally points to a compound object residing in a single 

repository, but an inherent function of a IIIF manifest is to point to digital objects that are 

distributed across two or more repositories. This process will prove highly advantageous as the 

cataloging of Tennysoniana develops.</p>

<p>The second methodology is the actual cataloging process developed to catalogue and digitally 

present multiple versions of “Break, break, break,” which include several drafts of a piano/vocal 

score composed by the poet’s wife, Emily. This dedicated study gives the project an early 

opportunity to establish the metadata for a few complex objects (ranging from the manuscript to 

the published, the textual to the musical score and its performance). Using standard metadata 

categories, we are creating transcriptions of images in TEI and MEI, in tandem with Encoded 

Archival Description (EAD).</p>

<p>Finally, we take a multimodal and interdisciplinary approach to interpreting “Break, break, 

break,” in relation to its various textual, visual and musical instantiations. In consultation with 

team members, the PI and co-PI have addressed questions about how the archival object can best 

be digitally presented (e.g., how exactly to toggle between digitized objects). We have also 

determined what editing and annotation protocols are required for individual items, and items in 

relation to one another.</p>

<p>The CDH has now built a web-based platform to support and provide access to all the 

components of this project. All the data is housed in a IIIF annotation store, including the 

manifests, the metadata and scholarly annotations created by the team. That data will be 

generated through a user interface (UI) that will allow the team to identify digital objects stored 

remotely at Cambridge Digital Library (or elsewhere), build the manifests for the compound 

objects, generate and store metadata (as well as modify existing records), and add scholarly 

annotations where appropriate. Users will furthermore have access to the digitized objects using 

Mirador. Mirador is a javascript plugin that is IIIF compliant and provides a number of ways to 

display digital images. In addition, the CDH has implemented an API that will allow third parties 

full and open access to the manifests, metadata and scholarly annotation.</p>


<h4>Copyright and technical considerations. 
</h4>
<p>We have secured David Lord Tennyson’s permission 

as well as the permission of the descendants of Mary Gladstone Drew for manuscript items 

displayed. The British Library and the Huntington Library agree to display of their archival 

objects on <em>Sounding Tennyson</em>, and to the hosting by CDH. Lincolnshire County Council agree 

to archival materials held by the Tennyson Research Centre being hosted by CDH and 

Cambridge Digital Library for <em>Sounding Tennysons</em> (with appropriate acknowledgements of their 

copyright). We release the project data under a Creative Commons CC BY SA license, 

<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a>. The musical recordings, captured before the 

planning project begins, are being made expressly for the Tennysons project, thus sidestepping 

the sort of copyright issues that can otherwise make such projects logistically prohibitive.</p>

<h4>Future development
</h4>
<p><em>Sounding Tennyson</em> is part of a larger, international digital humanities project, <em>Tennysons</em>, with is 

larger than a single project or grant. Phyllis Weliver and Ewan Jones are co-Principal 

Investigators for Tennysons.org, another IIIF-compatible project. Metadata for <em>Tennysons.org</em> 

will be hosted by the Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University, along with the 

sound files for the project. Currently, Cambridge Digital Library is creating a freely-available 

digital portal called <em>Tennysons</em>, which makes accessible a trove of Tennyson’s unpublished 

archival material and builds further tools to facilitate work on the multiform quality of his poetry, 

including visual elements. Cambridge Digital Library is committed to hosting IIIF-compatible 

digitized visual and textual materials for <em>Tennysons</em>.</p>

<p>The final goal, under the leadership of Dr Weliver, is to create the interface to present the 

transformation and perception of sound in Victorian Britain. In the first instance, it will focus on 

two powerful women (Emily Tennyson and Mary Gladstone) who were at the center of 

international literary and political life. Mary was the daughter of a long-serving British Prime 

Minister, the first woman in the Prime Ministerial Private Secretariat, and a prolific musical 

diarist. As the Tennysons and Gladstones were acquainted, digitizing their perceptions of music 

and poetry make interconnected samples of a much larger world of sound experience. Mary’s 

correspondence and journals (unpublished aside from extracts) provide precise perceptions of 

music through descriptions of performances, musical score notation, and reference to other 

musical pieces. In future, this project on nineteenth century sound might expand to studying the 

sonic dimension of other poets besides Tennyson.</p>

<h4>Sustainability of project outcomes and digital content</h4>

<p>The CDH is committed to long-term preservation and curation of all related metadata and 

annotation data. These are stored in the CDH’s IIIF-annotation store, which is part of the Saint 

Louis University network. Storage is supported by regular tape back up to avoid any data loss. 

Data stored on this annotation store will always be accessible through a set of APIs. All data 

stored as IIIF objects adhere strictly to the W3C standard supported by a growing community of 

30 international institutions, including Bodleian Libraries, British Library, Harvard University 

and Stanford University. This community is committed to supporting the format as an open 

standard and has already created several tools and shims that assure IIIF remains modern, 

interoperable, portable and convertible in the future when technologies surpass its capacity for 

data.</p>
