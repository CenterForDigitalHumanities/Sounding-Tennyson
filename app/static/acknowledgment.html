	<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
	<p>Learning to use digital tools to present multimedia material and arguments has been an
invigorating process for me, which has at its core the conversations and collaborations of a group
of generous colleagues. I cannot express enough respect and gratitude to the core team of Ewan
Jones, Donal Hegarty and Patrick Cuba. I am additionally indebted to Joanna Swafford whose
inspirational <em>and</em> practical digital tool, <a href="http://augmentednotes.com" target="_blank"><em>Augmented Notes</em></a>, helped me to conceive <em>Sounding Tennyson</em> in the first place.</p>
	<p>Digital humanities projects are collaborative by nature, but <em>Sounding Tennysons</em> seems to me
particularly so. Research-driven academics in North America and Britain have come together
with technicians to conceive and build the site, graduate students and undergraduates have
contributed to and learned from working on the project, international libraries and literary heirs
have kindly allowed us to display manuscript materials, and students of literature and of music in
US and UK classrooms have helpfully acted as test user groups. We are grateful to everyone who
has been involved in these capacities. This project also could not have happened without Leslie Neal’s and Renee Bolling’s patient administrative support.</p>
	<p>The details of moving a historic instrument by ferry to the Isle of Wight were unexpectedly
challenging, and we therefore want to extend a special thank you to Finchcocks Musical
Museum, Acorn Pianos and to piano tuner, Ron Bird, for helping us to work through the
particular details involved. The generosity and expertise of Francesco Izzo, Christine Armistead,
Chris Lucas, Jeanice Brooks, Rebecca FitzGerald, and Matthew and Kirsty Slade made it
possible to record the music with attention to historic accuracy. Finally, thank you to my family
for their unconditional support of me and this project, even when I had to be absent for longer
than any of us ideally wished.</p>
