        <h4>Preliminary</h4>
            <p>
                Phyllis Weliver first became interested in recovering the sound of Tennyson's
                recitations while writing a chapter on the subject for her book, <cite>Mary Gladstone
                    and the Victorian Salon</cite> (Cambridge University Press, 2017). She presented some
                of this work in progress between 2010 and 2014 in conference papers and invited
                lectures in North America and <rr-footnote>Britain.</rr-footnote>  This material was simultaneously the
            earliest development of <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> material.
        </p>
            <p>
                These talks mostly followed the norms of how arguments are presented in print form,
                although Dr. Weliver was already beginning to search for fresh approaches. Using
                PowerPoint, she displayed images of Emily Tennyson's piano/vocal scores of <rr-title type="poem">Break,
                break, break</rr-title> to support her discussion of Alfred Tennyson's scansion choices. Without
            a recording of the music, it was difficult to present the heard element in a conference
                or seminar room. During a lecture for the Music Department at the University of
                Southampton in 2011, however, Dr. Weliver asked musicologist and pianist Francesco
                Izzo if he would play the vocal and keyboard lines together on the available piano.
                Exemplifying musical passages is standard in musicology, but pianos (and pianists)
                are not usually available in non-music venues. The 2011–14 talks also frequently
                featured the speaker's reenactment of Tennyson's recitation of <rr-title type="poem">Song of Love and Death</rr-title>
                from <rr-title type="poem">Lancelot and Elaine,</rr-title> including his singing at the end of the poem. Dr. Weliver
                performed the poem because Tennyson's 1890 phonograph recording of the poem is unavailable
                except at the British Library, which holds an LP copy of the original wax cylinder.
                These were good first attempts to present historic sound materials, especially because
                it is unusual to make literary arguments using such methods (musical score and reenacted
                recitation), but clearly they were missing heard music and the recording itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, when Phyllis Weliver met Ewan Jones at the University of Cambridge in
                autumn 2013 (she was a Visiting Scholar at St Catharine's College), their complementary
                interests in the sonorous qualities of Tennyson's poems quickly became apparent. Dr.
                Jones had just finished an article on "Lyric Explanation: Tennyson's Princesses" for
                <cite>Thinking Verse</cite> (November 2014) and another essay on Browning's stuttering
                for <cite>Victorian Poetry</cite> (Summer 2015). He was also embarking on a large
                project on rhythm. The two scholars began co-writing an essay on the songs in Tennyson's
                <cite>The Princess</cite>, part of which was presented at the Midwest Victorian Studies Association
                (MVSA) in Iowa City <rr-footnote>(5/15).</rr-footnote>  During the drafting process, Dr. Jones suggested that
            the material might make for a good co-written book. Dr. Weliver agreed and additionally
                proposed a website that was both ancillary and stand alone to the book. The colleagues
                believed that such a site could better present multimedia material and arguments
                than the printed page, and that a digital application could additionally bring together
                archival items that are held in different collections around the world.
    </p>
    <h4>The case study</h4>
    <p>
        In April 2015, Dr. Weliver received generous funding from the Presidential
        Research Fund at Saint Louis University to lead a team in building a case study
        for <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite>. She and Dr. Jones had consulted together on the choice of
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> for this initial foray into
    building digital tools. As Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Weliver's research
    background in music and literature guided the decision first to present the
    musical elements of Tennyson's poetry. In late April, Dr. Jones travelled to Saint
    Louis University to consult in person with Dr. Weliver and the university's Center
    for Digital Humanities (CDH) on the overall plan for building the web application.
    As the project got underway, the two collaborators additionally organized how
    <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> would fit into a larger digital
    <cite><a href="http://tennysonsarchive.org" target="_blank">Tennysons Archive</a></cite>.
    Our ambition was in future to include more visual and textual material along with
    the sonic part of the project. Video conference meetings among the core team of
    Dr. Weliver, Dr. Jones, the CDH and Heather Bozant Witcher (research assistant
    and metadata inputter) continued on a weekly basis through July. We also included
    Jim Cheshire (University of Lincoln) and Sibylle Erle (Bishop Grosseteste
    University Lincoln) whose future digital resource on Tennyson will share
    <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/faq/" target="_blank">metadata standards</a>
    with the <cite>Tennysons Archive</cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the summer, Dr. Weliver worked with the CDH and Ms. Witcher to flesh out a
        data model and establish metadata criteria for those digitized textual and visual
        items included on the <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> site (e.g., scans of
        correspondence and musical scores). A brainstorming session helped the CDH to
        decide how to organize the many types of material:

            Figure 2. Donal Hegarty and Patrick Cuba, brainstorming on the design of Sounding Tennyson, summer 2015.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    Ms. Witcher additionally attended a coding school/workshop run by
    <a href="http://digitalmitford.org/workshop.html">Digital Mitford: The Mary Russell Mitford Archive</a>,
    which included training in TEI (<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text Encoding Initiative</a>).
    Also at this time, scanned musical scores were provided by the Lincolnshire
    County Council. Musicologist and pianist Francesco Izzo supplied the CDH with
    a piano version of Emily Tennyson's <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title>
    so that Patrick Cuba (lead developer) could begin building the web application
    with a sound sample of the correct duration. Ms. Witcher entered metadata over
    the summer, the project team made overall site design decisions, and Dr. Weliver
    began to get back into vocal shape with daily practice&mdash;not an easy feat!
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides Emily Tennyson's multi-draft musical settings of
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> and nineteenth-century pianist
    Natalie Janotha's arrangement of Emily's music, the team decided to include baritone
    Georg Henschel's setting of <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break.</rr-title>
    Because this famous Wagnerian singer had performed his composition for Tennyson,
    including it allowed for a more complex picture to be presented of Tennyson's
    relationship to <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break,</rr-title> as listener
    as well as author/reciter. Moreover, incorporating Henschel's music on the site
    addressed critical questions that were raised when the PI presented some of the
    material on Emily's setting of <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title>
    at the 2014 Modern Language Association of America (MLA) annual meeting. Co-panelists
    on the <cite><a href="https://sites.google.com/a/slu.edu/diversifying-the-victorian-verse-archives/">Diversifying the Victorian Verse Archives</a></cite>
    session spoke about the function of
    <cite><a href="http://www.augmentednotes.com/">Augmented Notes</a></cite> and
    <cite><a href="http://www.songsofthevictorians.com/">Songs of the Victorians</a></cite>
    (Joanna Swafford), and about the re-mediation of archives through digitization, including how
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> might "seem to sound" in
    various media (Yopie Prins). Presider Meredith Martin introduced the
    <cite><a href="http://prosody.princeton.edu/">Princeton Prosody Archive</a></cite>.
    In the Q&amp;A, scholars expressed enthusiasm alongside a concern that hearing a
    musical setting would influence all future encounters with the poem; it would be
    hard to consider the poem without simultaneously hearing the musical setting in
    the inner ear. To this, the panelists responded that studying multiple musical
    settings of any one poem might help to counter that experience. Additionally,
    because sonorous aspects of poems were vital to Victorian poets such as Tennyson,
    we wished to highlight the rich conversation that could emerge from engaging with
    musico-poetic material, rather than suggesting an <i>ur</i>-setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        In spring and summer 2015, Dr. Weliver worked to finalize the historic piano
        rental and moving details. This proved, unexpectedly, to be the most logistically
        difficult part of the project. In putting together the project proposal, we had
        obtained a quote from a piano firm who subsequently stopped communicating with
        us. After another abortive attempt with a different firm, we finally arranged to
        rent an 1858 Broadwood square piano through Finchcocks Musical Museum. One of the
        owners, Katrina Burnett, then generously worked with us to find a reputable, local
        piano firm to move and remove the piano. Repeatedly, potential piano movers
        communicated their reluctance to move an instrument by ferry to the Isle of Wight.
        At last we found Robert Plumridge of Acorn Pianos and a similarly highly qualified piano tuner, Ron Bird. Any
        piano needs time to adjust to the humidity and temperature of a new location, and
        historic instruments are especially prone to slipping out of tune. Without Ms.
        Burnett's substantial assistance in securing skilled piano services, we would not
        have been able to complete the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        We needed a piano built in the 1840s or 1850s, and Finchcocks had just the
        instrument for us. What a piano! Prince Albert had chosen it for Buckingham
        Palace, where it was used for concerts and balls during Albert's
    <rr-footnote>lifetime.</rr-footnote>  As is well known, the Prince Consort
    shared his passionate love of music with Queen Victoria during courtship
    and <rr-footnote>marriage.</rr-footnote> He probably played this instrument and Tennyson may also have
    encountered it, for the Queen was very fond of Tennyson. She was his neighbor
    at <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/osborne/http:/www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/osborne/">Osborne</a>
    on the Isle of Wight as well as in London, where the Tennysons' house at 9
    Upper Belgrave Street was three blocks from Buckingham Palace. After Albert's
    death in 1861, Queen Victoria arranged with John Broadwood & Sons for the
    instrument to be permanently loaned for Prince Albert's memorial room.

        Over the autumn and early winter, the CDH built the web application and
        tested the integration of different digital objects. In coordination with
        the pianist and sound engineer, the PI confirmed the rental date of the drawing room at
        <a href="http://farringford.co.uk/">Farringford</a> (we were the first to
        hire a function room in the newly renovated house). She also confirmed door-to-door insurance
        for the instrument. Simultaneously, Bruce Durazzi consulted with the PI and
        the CDH to make cataloguing decisions and to code the music metadata. This process
        is extremely time-consuming because in MEI
        (<a href="http://music-encoding.org/">Music Encoding Initiative</a>),
        every note value must be catalogued so as to be machine readable (unlike the much simpler TEI, which uses
        <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>). We are now one of about
        fourteen projects world-wide that uses MEI. In the USA, we join Maryland
        Institute for Technology and Haverford College. International users include
        teams from Universität der Künste Berlin in partnership with Hebrew University
        Jerusalem; The Danish Centre for Music Publication; Universität Würzburg,
        Germany; Université de Genèva; King's College, London; and McGill University, Montréal.
        Using MEI aligns <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> with an industry standard for
        now. In future, we plan to develop its uses by building or modifying existing
        tools so as to provide comment features when users click or mouse over
        particular parts of the musical staves, to depict relationships among other
        objects on the site, and to resolve the synching problems that occasionally
        occur between the integrated image and audio files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Preparing the music helped the PI better to understand the original material,
        too. Not only is digital humanities a "model of pedagogy that emphasizes
        learning through making and <rr-footnote>doing,"</rr-footnote> but performing
    vocal repertoire can also reveal more about poetry. After struggling with
    the song's low register, Dr. Weliver asked Dr. Durazzi to transpose all the
    music up a third or more. The original key of Emily Tennyson's
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> (including the arrangements
    by Janotha) is E major/minor, as is seen on the scores presented on <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite>,
    but it is sung in A. Because Henschel was a baritone and the PI is a soprano, we
    also transposed the Henschel setting from the original E minor to G minor. Henschel
    was skilled at writing for voice, making his piece the easiest to sing in one sense,
    although the Wagnerian style presented its own challenges. Emily Tennyson's settings
    are just plain hard, however, because this amateur composer clearly attempted to
    achieve certain effects without the requisite competence: there are vowels that
    are difficult to sing on high notes, unusual rhythms, and strange articulations
    in the piano line. For the Emily Tennyson settings in particular, the PI was unable
    to project in the lower register and was becoming hoarse. For expressivity's sake
    as well as vocal health, the melodic line needed to lie higher. As seen in the
    archival materials on this site, an original singer and arranger
    of Emily's music came to the same conclusion (baritone Charles Santley and
    composer C.V. Stanford).
    </p>
    <p>
        In October and November, the PI had four lessons with Christine Armitage,
        with whose assistance Dr. Weliver began to realize that her interpretation
        needed to be primarily musically guided, not steered so much by what she
        knew about the poetry and Tennyson's practices. What did the rests in the
        middle of the first line of <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title>
    <em>really</em> suggest about delivery and meaning, for instance? They
    begged for melodramatic pauses. The sung performances on this site therefore
    make musical choices. The result can then be compared to Tennyson's manuscript
    and published poem, as well as to contextual information about what it was
    like to hear the poet's recitations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The voice lessons fit around the PI's two autumn research trips to Britain,
        during which Dr. Weliver consulted with Dr. Jones about the development of
        <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> and the overarching <cite>Tennysons Archive</cite>.
        In October, the PI also travelled to the Tennyson Research Centre in Lincoln
        in order further to research archival materials to be included on the site
        (correspondence and Emily Tennyson journal entries). During the December
        visit, she searched at the British Library for additional textual examples
        of people who listened to recitations or performances of
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> during the poet's lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr. Weliver flew to the UK in December primarily to record
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> in its multiple versions
    at the Tennysons' recently reconstructed home on the Isle of Wight. After
    rehearsing with Dr. Izzo in Southampton, the performers and sound engineer,
    Chris Lucas, loaded up a car with recording equipment and took the ferry to
    the Isle of Wight. Jeanice Brooks, a specialist on English country house music,
    met us there. The piano had been moved to Farringford a few days previously
    in order to give it time to settle in.

    <p>
        By December 2015, Farringford had mostly been restored except for its furnishings.
        Because we wished to capture historically accurate acoustics, our first task upon
        arrival was to deaden the resonance of the drawing room. To the existing bench,
        armchair, table and piano, we added a heavy rug, which we unrolled on the hardwood floor.
        The sound engineer began setting up equipment and the rest of us further covered
        the floor with green blankets used by the piano mover. Reluctantly, we shut out
        the gorgeous view with thick red curtains. Dr. Izzo, Dr. Brooks and the PI agreed
        that the singer should face in the same direction as the pianist, toward the music.
        Pictures, life writing and Victorian novels depict this performance practice, as
        opposed to the twentieth- and twenty-first-century norm where the singer faces the
        audience from the crook of a grand piano or with her back to an upright. Mr. Lucas
        placed the final microphones and sound tests began.

    <p>
        We recorded several takes each of the Emily Tennyson settings of
    <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title> that first afternoon
    (differing rhythms in the earlier and later versions required two versions,
    one for drafts one and two, and the other for draft three and the engraved music).
    Discussions about interpretation occurred between each take, and our choices were
    further influenced by listening to the recordings. Because we wished to capture
    Farringford's acoustics and ambient noise, we could only use single takes (we did
    not splice together several takes or otherwise edit a single song as it would
    destroy reverberation and other environmental noises, including the creak of the
    pianist's chair). We then returned a second day to record the Janotha and Henschel
    settings of the poem. On this occasion, we had to stop for several hours until a
    gardener outside had finished trimming the hedges. The motorized buzz was certainly
    not part of the Tennysons' soundscape! However, we were thrilled to hear the wind
    gusting outside on this second day. We had not expected this sonorous accompaniment
    to all that occurred in the drawing room, and such a discovery further validated
    the decision to record at Farringford in the first place. The wind can be heard
    at the end of the Henschel recording on the .wav files. Because it is less obvious
    on the condensed .mp3 and .ogg files, we hope in future to increase its volume on the
    <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> site so as better to convey what we actually heard.
    </p>
    <p>
        In sound and sight, we want to help the user to experience the atmosphere
        of Farringford. The restored hallways in the house are painted a mossy green,
        trimmed near the ceiling with red and gold. One room has particularly beautiful
        floral wallpaper with green, red, gold and lavender on a cream background. These
        shades informed the palette of the <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> site. While
        we were at Farringford, we also walked in Tennyson's footsteps along the downs.
        Being there helped us imaginatively while we were recording. Only then did the
        PI realize how the sound of breaking waves could differ so dramatically when
        heard from the beach as opposed to atop a cliff&mdash;exactly the position of
        the speaker in <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break.</rr-title>

        In January 2016, the sound engineer supplied the sound files in .wav
        format and the PI worked with the
        <cite><a href="http://www.augmentednotes.com/">Augmented Notes</a></cite>
        site to synch recordings with images of the scores. She first transferred
        image files from .tif to .jpeg (they loaded best this way), and additionally
        transferred each sound file to mp3 and .ogg files, ensuring that the audio
        would play across different <rr-footnote>platforms.</rr-footnote>  After that,
    each song took about two hours from uploading the transferred image and sound files,
    through formatting the bars, synching the audio, and producing the final version
    with measures highlighted to move in time with the music. It's a great tool! The PI
    discovered that working with manuscript scans was easier on Google Chrome, which
    produced a sharper and darker image than did Firefox. The Emily Tennyson manuscripts
    presented further challenges because of squashed measures and slanted bar lines. At present,
    <cite>Augmented Notes</cite> limits how narrow it can make a measure and only allows
    users to draw rectangular outlines of measures, although site developer Joanna Swafford
    plans to introduce more <rr-footnote>shapes in future.</rr-footnote>  Where necessary, the PI chose to follow
    the top stave with the digital application since the vocal melody remains mostly
    unaltered in arrangement (unlike the accompaniment). For consistency, she applied
    the same rule to places which only feature the piano part (no vocal line).

    <p>
After incorporating the <cite>Augmented Notes</cite> files into the <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite>
coding, we discovered that occasionally the boxes moving in time to the music went out of sync.
This occurs because <cite>Augmented Notes</cite> uses .mp3 and .ogg files, or two audio files that are slightly
different lengths. If the files do go out of sync, try switching to another server (the file is
properly synched with whichever server the PI used to create the <cite>Augmented Notes</cite>
file – Google Chrome or Firefox). Because it is machine readable, using MEI would probably better
link with the time stamps in the audio files. <cite>Augmented Notes</cite> provides the opportunity to upload MEI,
but because our MEI takes into account variants across multiple drafts, including bars that
run across page breaks, our MEI is not compatible with <cite>Augumented Notes</cite>. In future,
we aspire to use our MEI as the basis for developing tools that resolve this synching issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        During January and February, Dr. Weliver wrote multimedia essays and website text,
        and solicited the other essays. Dr. Durazzi delivered the MEI and a musically edited
        engraving of what seemed to be Emily Tennyson's final compositional choices. The CDH
        team worked to hand code the essays, to integrate the sound files into the existing
        web application, and to upload all digitized objects. The Lead Developer, Patrick Cuba,
        shared a spread sheet of all <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> items with the PI,
        who was able thus to ensure accuracy in identification and inclusion of all digitized objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        In February and March, test user groups offered feedback
        that helped us to polish the site. These user groups mostly comprised high
        school seniors, graduate students, and professional academics
        in the fields of English literature and digital humanities. We also
        invited responses from a few members of the public. In future, we will include
        test user groups in the UK (musicologists as well as students of literature),
        as well as undergraduate user groups in the USA. Our aim is to receive feedback
        that will contribute to the site’s continued development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, just twelve months after receiving our first funding, <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> is live. We
        hope that you find the case study of <rr-title type="poem">Break, Break, Break</rr-title>
    enjoyable and useful. With time, the site will feature all twenty-four, multi-draft
    songs with music by Emily Tennyson and words by Alfred Tennyson, iterative and shareable
    digital tools, more interactive MEI, and a more robust soundscape.
