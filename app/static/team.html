	Dr Bruce Durazzi, has the required (and rare) skill set: music theory, library science 
	and coding. <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/music/about/staff/fi1k06.page" target="_blank">Dr Francesco Izzo</a>

<h4>Key Personnel</h4>
<p><strong>Phyllis Weliver</strong>, Principal Investigator (PI) and singer, is Associate Professor of English at Saint Louis University. This digital project grows out of Dr Weliver’s previous scholarship, which investigates how literature reveals music to have been a deeply entrenched part of nineteenth-century British life. She is in the unusual position of producing work that truly speaks to two audiences. Within the field of literature, her second monograph appears in the esteemed Palgrave Studies in Nineteenth-Century Writing and Culture series and her first monograph is being reissued in the Routledge Library Edition: 19th Century Novel series (2006, 2016). Her other published books appear in music lists (2000, 2005, 2013, 2017). Phyllis Weliver’s research has contributed to BBC Two Television and BBC Radio 3 in the UK, and has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities in the US (Fellowship, 2014; Summer Stipend, 2005). Although by no means a professional singer, Dr Weliver was a National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts ARTS Awardee in Classical Voice when she was a high school senior at Interlochen Arts Academy. She went on to study with Carol Webber at Oberlin Conservatory of Music and is currently enjoying getting back into vocal shape under the guidance of Christine Armistead in Saint Louis.</p>

<p><strong>The Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University</strong> exists in part to support faculty as they develop research projects that have a digital humanities component. Its research staff has experience in developing web-based applications that are highly usable and attuned to the needs of advanced research. It is recognized as a major research center in digital humanities.</p>

<p><strong>Ewan Jones</strong>, co-Investigator for <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> and co-PI for <cite>Tennysons Archive</cite>, is Lecturer in English at the University of Cambridge and Digital Humanities Research Associate on <a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/people/profile/ewan-jones" target="_blank">The Concept Lab</a> project at <a href="http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank">CRASSH</a> (Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities). He is the author of <cite>Coleridge and the Philosophy of Poetic Form</cite> (Cambridge, 2014) and numerous articles on 19th-century poetry. 
</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Durazzi</strong>, music metadata specialist and music engraver. <cite>Sounding Tennyson</cite> requires a robust and interoperable metadata scheme that includes a descriptive catalog of the original artifacts along with the digital surrogates from the literary and musical texts. In consultation with the PI and the CDH, Dr Durazzi created the <a href="http://music-encoding.org/" target="_blank">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI) metadata scheme and code. He also provided a clean performance copy of the music to the singer and pianist.
</p>
<p><strong>Francesco Izzo</strong>, pianist and consultant, is Professor of Music at the University of Southampton specializing in 19th-century opera. He is the author of <cite>Laughter between Two Revolutions: Opera buffa in Italy, 1831-1848</cite> (University of Rochester Press, 2013) and general editor of the "Works of Giuseppe Verdi" series (Ricordi and University of Chicago Press). As a pianist, Dr Izzo has performed widely as a soloist, with orchestras and as a vocal accompanist. He has collaborated with distinguished opera singers and provided stylistic advice, ornamentation and cadenzas for opera singers. He frequently lectures, contributes program notes and consults at opera houses, including Glyndebourne, Sarasota Opera and the Royal Opera House.
