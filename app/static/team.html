<div><h4>Project Leadership</h4>

<p>The CDH has extensive experience in multi-institutional collaboration. Dr Weliver provides the 
 
 overall leadership of the <em>Sounding Tennyson</em> project and the CDH provides infrastructural 
 
 support to coordinate video conferencing and in-person meetings. Decisions are made 
 
 collaboratively with Dr Jones (co-Investigator), in conversation with Lincolnshire County 
 
 Council. The music metadata specialist has the required (and rare) skill set: music theory, library 
 
 science and coding.</p> 

<h4>Research Staff</h4>

<dl class="dl-inline"><DT>Phyllis Weliver, </DT>
<dd>Principal Investigator (PI) and singer, is Associate Professor of English at Saint 

Louis University. This digital project grows out of Dr Weliver’s previous scholarship, which 

investigates how literature reveals music to have been a deeply entrenched part of nineteenth-century British life. She is in the unusual position of producing work that truly speaks to two 

audiences. Within the field of literature, her second monograph appears in the well-regarded 

Palgrave Studies in Nineteenth-Century Writing and Culture series and her first monograph is 

being reissued in the Routledge Library Edition: 19th Century Novel series (2006, 2016). Her 

other published books appear in music lists (2000, 2005, 2013, 2017).</dd>

<DT>Ewan Jones, </DT>
<dd>co-Investigator for Sounding Tennyson and co-PI for Tennysons.org is Lecturer in 
 
 English at the University of Cambridge and a past Digital Humanities Research Associate on The 
 
 Concept Lab project at CRASSH (Centre for Research in the Arts, Social Sciences and 
 
 Humanities). He is the author of <cite>Coleridge and the Philosophy of Poetic Form</cite> (Cambridge, 
 
 2014) and numerous articles on 19th-century poetry.</dd> 

<DT>The Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University,</DT>
 <dd>a collaboration among the 
 
 College of Arts and Sciences, the University Library, and the Walter J. Ong Center, exists in part 
 
 to support faculty as they develop research projects that have a digital humanities component. Its 
 
 research staff has experience in developing web-based applications that are highly usable and 
 
 attuned to the needs of advanced research. It is recognized as a major research center in digital 
 
 humanities.</dd>

<DT>Francesco Izzo, </DT>
<dd>pianist and consultant, is Associate Professor of Music at the University of 

Southampton specializing in 19th-century opera.</dd></dl>

<h4>Sustainability of project outcomes and digital content</h4>

<p>The CDH is committed to long-term preservation and curation of all related metadata and 

annotation data. These are stored in the CDH’s IIIF-annotation store, which is part of the Saint 

Louis University network. Storage is supported by regular tape back up to avoid any data loss. 

Data stored on this annotation store will always be accessible through a set of APIs. All data 

stored as IIIF objects adhere strictly to the W3C standard supported by a growing community of 

30 international institutions, including Bodleian Libraries, British Library, Harvard University 

and Stanford University. This community is committed to supporting the format as an open 

standard and has already created several tools and shims that assure IIIF remains modern, 

interoperable, portable and convertible in the future when technologies surpass its capacity for 

data.</p>
