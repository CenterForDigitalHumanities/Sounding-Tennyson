                In 1879, Tennyson read aloud his poem, “The Revenge,” to Joseph Joachim, one of the greatest violinists of the century and a friend of Johannes Brahms. Tennyson’s London gatherings sometimes featured recitations by himself and performances by the Hungarian-born Joachim. After the other guests had departed, the bard liked to smoke and talk with the virtuoso. On this particular occasion, Tennyson followed his recitation with the query, “‘Could you do that on your violin’ – the peace of nature after the thunder of the <rr-footnote>battle.”</rr-footnote>  If Joachim began with the thunder, there is good cause to think that he would have rendered nature’s peace with a sudden contrast in pace and dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
                In one of the pieces for which Joachim was best known, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV_YXtUs_Ow">Brahms’ Hungarian Dance in D Minor, No. 2</a>, we can hear the tempo picking up and slowing down in an alternation that defies the regularity of any metronome. Of course, Brahms wrote the piece with tempo shifts [<i>ritardando</i> (gradually slower) at the end of phrases, <i>vivace</i> (lively) as a new phrase begins], but Joachim’s transitions are more unpredictable than modern performance practice. We can hear the contrast in a recording of the same piece by German violinist, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5VbwHGRrwE">Anne-Sophie Mutter</a>. It is easy to hear a freer rhythm in Joachim’s version.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is good reason to suppose that Tennyson’s recitations were similarly changeable. We have seen Tennyson directly compare his spoken poetry to Joachim’s fiddling. Witnesses also noted the irregularity of Tennyson’s readings. Mary Gladstone recalled of hearing Tennyson read Maud, “it was wondrous the fire + fervour + despair he alternately put into it. now like a passionate youth than [sic] a worn out old man.  […] even the “Go not, happy day” seemed an inspired rushing 1/2 mad burst of exultation. + the lovely little tender similes + caressing words which he read in a sort of low loving <rr-footnote>voice”.</rr-footnote>  Miss Gladstone summarized the performance’s reception: “We listened transfixed_ + I thought apart from the strange wild story, how astonishing the poetry <rr-footnote>was.”</rr-footnote>  As a prime minister’s daughter, Mary frequently encountered the best performances; such a response is therefore notable. “Oh my winkie”, she likewise wrote upon hearing Joachim play privately after dinner, “it was marvellous [sic]. I was introduced to him + my feelings were nearly too many for <rr-footnote>me.”</rr-footnote>  One wonders what it would have been like to hear these masters of poetry and of music perform at the same venue.

                Similarly, Emily Tennyson’s musical treatment of “Break, break, break” shows emotional variability. Rapid fluctuations of modes and moods can be seen in the key changes of Emily’s setting:

                </rr-poem>
                Because of an abrupt change to E minor in the middle of line 11 and its chromatic treatment (moving by half-steps), “touch of a vanish’d hand” gains harmonic emphasis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The song changes mood every two to four lines, too, with the help of fermatas between stanzas; the pauses punctuate the ever-changing feelings. When listening to the song, we can hear how the tragic first stanza jumps to a chirpy second stanza about shouting and singing boys. The third stanza solemnly progresses to consider other worlds. After the major keys of “stately ships” and the grave (“haven under the hill”), the chromatic slippage out of the tonal center makes “the touch of a vanished hand” sound like ghostly yearning. The final stanza begins with a visual repetition of the poem’s first line, but in sonorous variation since the commas are no longer strongly marked with rests. Halfway through this final stanza, “But” (line 15) signals a further turn in direction, accompanied by a musical language that echoes that of the “stately ships go on”, thereby religiously inflecting “tender grace of a day that is dead”. Tempo also communicates instabilities in mood, in the song’s shifting pace after each fermata as well as in the poem’s meter.

                This strong evidence suggests that Tennyson’s strong desire to preserve the sound meaning of the poem (by double recordings of “Break, Break, Break” in Emily’s music and on the phonograph’s wax cylinder) may have been because the poem had several uncommon sonorous moments that included, but were not limited to, how to read the line. The musical setting, for example, helps us to understand how Emily heard Tennyson say the poem in a free anapaestic <rr-footnote>meter.</rr-footnote>  Mostly iambs (slack-stress) alternate with the anapests (slack-slack-stress) in “Break, Break, Break.” However, the poem also has an amphibrach (slack-stress-slack) line or two, a pyrrhic (two slacks) and, in early drafts, a catalytic line (the trochee at the end lacks the final slack):

            If we leave aside the repeated, “Break, break, break” (lines 1, 13), Emily’s treatment of the poem suggests that Tennyson gave equal length or quantity to the rest of the syllables rather than lengthening the stressed ones, although there is an important category of exception (the Scotch Snap, to which I return). Without knowing the musical setting, we would almost certainly scan line 3 as anapest-anapest-amphibrach (without the additional length on the last syllable) and the final line as amphibrach-iamb-iamb (without the added emphasis on “never”). The result would be a much less rhythmically variable and emotionally unstable sonic world than Emily’s song presents.

            </p>

                 One of the most intriguing elements of “Break, Break, Break,” as well as other poems put to music by Emily Tennyson, is the poet’s use of the Scotch Snap – his shortening of the stressed syllable in “utter” and “never” (lines 3, 16). In their article, <a target="_blank" href="http://theory.esm.rochester.edu/temperley/papers/temperley-temperley-mp.pdf">“Music-Language Correlations and the ‘Scotch Snap,’”</a> Nicholas and David Temperley have defined the Snap as a rhythmic figure found in English, Irish, Scottish and American vocal music from as early as 1675, “typically consisting of a division of a quarter-note tactus in the ratio of 1:3, that is, a sixteenth and a dotted eighth, with one syllable on each note, and with the sixteenth on the <rr-footnote>beat.”</rr-footnote>  For example, they show how “trouble” in The Beatles’ “Let It Be” is a Snap (61):

                 </figure>
                 The Temperleys make clear that from the middle of the eighteenth century, although the Snap appears in many English-language songs, it occurs with significantly greater frequency in Scottish music. This 1:3 ratio can also be found in other divisions in “Break, Break, Break,” as in the eighth: dotted half note of “fisher” (first two drafts only) and “never”, lending jauntiness to “fisher” and emphasizing the finality of “never.” The treatment of “utter” is odd for it extends the Snap to the ratio of 1:4. Strictly speaking, the Snap should be an eighth: dotted quarter, like the treatment of “never”. In recitation, Tennyson seems to have lengthened “utter” into the guttural “er” (“utterrrr”) – an onomatopœtic communication, but also such an unexpected treatment as to throw us off balance. It is difficult to sing and to say. Similarly, the catalytic line (in Emily’s first and second musical drafts), leaving off the expected final slack, is hard to vocalize.

                Line 5 shows a fascinating example of the continuing reworking of the sonorous intent of this line long after the poem was published in 1842. The final musical version sets the line as an iamb-pyrrhic-trochee-iamb, which is more regular than the earlier drafts. Without the catalytic line, there is no feeling of lack (a missing slack). Even though Emily Tennyson did not want her arranger, Natalie Janotha, to change her vocal lines in the early 1890s, quite possibly the Tennysons responded to how Janotha did indeed alter the line (equal length for each syllable in “fisherman”). What can be confidently observed, however, is that certain sonorous elements of the poem were reworked by the Tennysons over four decades after “Break, Break, Break” seemed done, or fixed in its final published form.

               I find this multiplicity of sonic meaning very suggestive, for it is sometimes hard to decide the chronology of revisions. As can clearly be seen in <i>each</i> manuscript draft, Emily went back over her original notation and added in heavy breaks after the first two words of the poem. Normally, we only make changes to our last draft. Because all of the drafts have this change in common, they do not necessarily trace a clear chronology of first, next and last thoughts about the rhythm of line one. The Tennysons kept playing with the poem’s meaning, changing their idea of how to set the poetry to music, and changing it in all <rr-footnote>drafts.</rr-footnote>

                To me, this process suggests that the last penned or published version does not have to be the definitive version, even in those instances when all drafts were changed. The Tennysons could easily have performed a variant even after the ink had dried. I must admit to preferring the Scotch Snap on “fisher” (drafts 1 and 2): it sounds more interesting and communicates emotional imbalance even as the speaker narrates the joy of a young boy. But then, I like the heavy pauses between the first two “breaks” (changed in all drafts); they are emotionally intense and contrast with repeated the “Break, break, break” in the final line. Such sonic and emotional variability highlights interpretative processes and, in a sense, performs the poem’s inherent living, off-the-page qualities.
